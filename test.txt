Pass in multiple files as an array, 
and they will be parsed in order and combined with process.env
(or option.processEnv, if set). The first value set for a variable will win,
unless the options.override flag is set, in which case the last value set will win.
If a value already exists in process.env and the options.override flag is NOT set, 
no changes will be made to that value.
